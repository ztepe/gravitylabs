CodeLouisville front end project by Zack Tepe

Welcome to Gravity Labs! The idea for this project comes from an idea my friend and I are working on in real life. 
I wanted to play around with how the future website could look and start brainstorming the content. 

2 media queries:
I have started my styling with a "normalize" sheet then designed the website for mobile devices with my small.css file. 
From there the page makes 2 media queries for devices with medium and large screen widths that change a couple things 
so they work better on larger screens. The first change you will see is when the screen reaches medium width, the menu 
button dissapears and the menu items are visible across the top of the page. The next change you will see is on the 
transition to large screens, the form and form text move from vertically stacked to side by side.
    
CSS(2):
I am using a collapsable navigation menu that dissapears on medium/large screens. I am also utilizing flexbox to organize 
content at the bottom of the page. Both items respond to the page being viewed at different sizes.

JAVA(2):
My primary Java function is a form that checks both for a name being entered and for phone number length between 10 and 15 digits. I have also returned the Zame entered underneath the "get in touch" button. I have also utilized the alert function to display a message before accessing the page that tells visitors to fill out the 
form at the bottom of the page.
